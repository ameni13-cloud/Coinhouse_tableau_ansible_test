# Coinhouse_tableau_ansible_test
An ansible role that install Tableau on ubuntu 18 


In this playbook, we will install an instance of Tableau Server for Linux that has the following characteristics: 

* Operating System: Supported RHEL-type Linux distributions, Ubuntu or Suse
* Identity store: local authentication
* Gateway Port: 80


To start the process you’ll need a fresh copy of Linux on a machine that meets Tableau Server’s minimum hardware requirements (64-bit 2 core processor, 8 GB RAM, 15 GB free space). 

** The Tableau Server installer is intended for interactive installation and configuration of Tableau server. This approach works well for many users and administrators, but limits the ability to perform automated deployments using tools like Chef or Puppet.
